VERSION: 0.2.1, 15-04-2021

AUTHORS: 18008890

PATCH NOTES:

Sam is spawned on the screen. He now has a fully animated sprite that changes animation when he walks around. The InputManager has been refactored
and now supports mouseinputs. A camera class has been developed and tracks the players movements. The user can scroll in and out using the mouse wheel.

Interfaces have been refactored to implement properties, this allowed the removal of extensive type casting between InputManager and SceneManager.
